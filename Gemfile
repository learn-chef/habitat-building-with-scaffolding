# Here we are specifying the gems that we need to have installed for
# our application to run. This file is used by Ruby's Bundler, a
# dependency management tool.

# @see http://bundler.io/

# To install the dependencies you would run:
#
#     $ bundle install
#

# We must provide a source location where to look for Ruby gems.
# This is often the default source.
